# Mod-3 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description 

- First item For this project, I will create an application that will enable emplyees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they will select.
- Second item This application will run in the browser and will feature updated HTML and CSS supported by JavaScript that I will write.
- Third item The webpage and code will be clean and will have a responsive user interface that will adjust to multiple screen sizes.
- Fourth item I will make sure that my code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
- Fifth item I will review my code, look for problems and fix those issues.
- Sixth item By building this webpage, it has helped me to learn information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT, GitHub, READme markdown information, and Deployment.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
